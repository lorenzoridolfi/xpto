# Architecture Overview

The architecture is built around two core classes that provide all necessary functionality while maintaining simplicity and extensibility. The EnhancedAgent class serves as the foundation, wrapping any Autogen agent type while adding state persistence, text variable handling, feedback collection, behavior adaptation, and message history management. The CollaborativeWorkflow class handles orchestration, managing multi-agent interactions, task distribution, consensus building, state synchronization, and workflow control.

This design achieves a clean and maintainable architecture through several key principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a clear, focused purpose
- Composition over Inheritance: Functionality is added through composition rather than inheritance
- Autogen Compatibility: Maintains seamless integration with existing Autogen agents
- Clear Extension Points: Provides well-defined interfaces for customization
- Simple Interface: Keeps the API straightforward and intuitive

Example Integration:
```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from enhanced_agent import EnhancedAgent

# Create base Autogen agents with detailed descriptions
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4"}]},
    system_message="""You are an expert AI assistant with deep knowledge in software development, 
    problem-solving, and technical communication. Your role is to:

    base_agent=assistant,
    role="assistant",
    state_persistence=True,
    capabilities=["code_generation", "explanation"],

)

# Use enhanced agents in collaboration
workflow = CollaborativeWorkflow(
    agents=[enhanced_assistant, enhanced_user_proxy],
    consensus_required=True
)
```

This design allows developers to:
- Keep using Autogen's specialized agents
- Add enhanced capabilities when needed
- Maintain compatibility with existing Autogen workflows
- Gradually adopt enhanced features

The `EnhancedAgent` class acts as a wrapper that adds capabilities while preserving the original agent's functionality, making it a complementary addition to Autogen's agent system rather than a replacement.

#### Text Variables and Message Handling

The `EnhancedAgent` class extends Autogen's text variable handling while maintaining compatibility with Autogen's message system. Here's how it works:

1. **Message Structure**
```python
class EnhancedAgent:
    def __init__(self, base_agent, role, state_persistence=True, capabilities=None):
        """
        Initialize an enhanced agent.
        
        Args:

            state_persistence (bool): Whether to persist state
            capabilities (list): List of agent capabilities
        """

    def register_text_variable(self, name, value, description=None):
        """

        Args:
            name (str): Variable name
            
        Returns:
            str: Variable value
        """

    def update_text_variable(self, name, value):
        """
        Update a text variable's value.
        
        Args:
            name (str): Variable name
            value (str): New value
        """

    def process_message(self, message):

        """

    def load_state(self, checkpoint_name):
        """

```

2. **Usage Example**
```python
# Create an enhanced agent
agent = EnhancedAgent(
    base_agent=assistant,
    role="assistant",
    state_persistence=True
)

# Register text variables
agent.register_text_variable(
    "user_name",
    "John",
    "Name of the current user"
)
agent.register_text_variable(
    "project_name",
    "AI Assistant",
    "Current project name"
)

# Use variables in messages
message = "Hello {user_name}, welcome to the {project_name} project!"
processed_message = agent.process_message(message)
# Result: "Hello John, welcome to the AI Assistant project!"

# Update variables
agent.update_text_variable("user_name", "Jane")
processed_message = agent.process_message(message)
# Result: "Hello Jane, welcome to the AI Assistant project!"
```

This implementation:
- Maintains compatibility with Autogen's message system
- Adds persistent text variables
- Tracks variable history and updates
- Supports variable replacement in messages
- Preserves message history
- Enables state persistence for variables

The text variable system allows for:
- Dynamic message content
- Variable tracking and updates
- State persistence
- Message history
- Seamless integration with Autogen

### 2. AdaptiveAgent

adaptive_agent = AdaptiveAgent(
    base_agent=AssistantAgent(
        name="adaptive_assistant",
        llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4"}]}
    ),
    role="adaptive_assistant",
    capabilities=["context_analysis", "behavior_adaptation", "history_tracking"],
    description="""An adaptive agent that learns and evolves:
